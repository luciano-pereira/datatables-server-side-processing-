descrição do projeto
###################

se você estiver trabalhando com bancos de dados extremamente grandes, convém consideraro
uso das opções do lado do servidorfornecidas pelo DataTables. Com o processamento do lado
do servidor ativado, todas as ações que o DataTables realiza (como paginação, pesquisa e ordenação)
são entregues a um servidor onde um mecanismo SQL (ou similar) pode executar essas ações no grande
conjunto de dados (afinal, é isso que o mecanismo de banco de dados é projetado para!). Assim, cada
sorteio da tabela resultará em uma nova solicitação do Ajax para obter os dados necessários.

What is CodeIgniter
###################

CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people
who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects
much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing
a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple
interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets
you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed
for a given task.
